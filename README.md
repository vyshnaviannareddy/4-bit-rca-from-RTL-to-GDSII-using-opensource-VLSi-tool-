## 💡 Project Overview & Physical Constraints

A **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** serves as a fundamental combinational building block where the carry bit propagates sequentially through each full adder stage ($C_0 \to C_1 \to C_2 \to C_3$). While architecturally straightforward, executing its physical implementation through an ASIC backend highlights key design trade-offs regarding carry propagation delay, power rail distribution, and standard cell area optimization.

This project drives a behavioral Verilog model of a 4-bit RCA completely through the automated **OpenLane** flow to achieve a tapeout-ready macro layout targeting the **SkyWater 130nm (`sky130A`)** open PDK.

## 📖 The RTL-to-GDSII Visual Journey

Follow the automated physical design pipeline execution step-by-step with verified visual checkpoints from our runtime workspace:

### 1️⃣ RTL Design & Functional Verification
The behavioral logic of the 4-bit adder was validated using a comprehensive testbench. Waveform inspection in GTKWave confirms correct 4-bit addition (`A + B + Cin = Sum, Cout`) across varied test vectors.

</p>

### 2️⃣ Logic Synthesis & Power Reports
The Verilog source description is mapped into structural gates using 20 standard cells from the `sky130_fd_sc_hd` library (including `xnor2`, `nand2`, `nor2`, `or2`, `a21bo`, and `and2` gates). The resulting module area is 183.926 μm² with a total power draw of 14.5 µW.

  <img src="rca%20ss/power.png" width="48%" alt="Power Consumption Summary">
</p>

### 3️⃣ Floorplanning & Power Delivery Network (PDN)
The core boundary is initialized and I/O pins (`A[3:0]`, `B[3:0]`, `cin`, `sum[3:0]`, `cout`) are arranged along the periphery. Power rings and vertical/horizontal power stripes (`VDD`/`GND`) are inserted to ensure IR drop integrity.

> 💡 **Pro-Tip for Interactive Workspace Viewing:**
> To explore the layout database interactively using OpenROAD GUI:
> 1. Start the container: `make mount`
> 2. Open the interface: `openroad -gui`
> 3. Source the layout database file: `read_db runs/<run_name>/results/floorplan/rca.odb`

<p align="center">

</p>

### 4️⃣ Global & Detailed Placement
Standard cells are legally placed into core rows. The placement tool balances local density and wirelength to minimize routing congestion.

</p>

### 5️⃣ Interconnect Routing
Signal interconnects are routed across multi-layer metal grids (`met1`–`met5`) using TritonRoute, preserving minimum manufacturing rules and resolving wire track overlaps.

### 6️⃣ Physical Signoff & Verification (DRC/LVS)
The finished layout was exported for signoff verification. Magic DRC confirms **0 violations**, Netgen LVS confirms a clean **45-net match**, and antenna checks pass clean with **0 violations**.

## 🚀 How to Reproduce

Rebuild this physical layout blueprint on your local environment:

### Prerequisites:
* Linux OS (Ubuntu environment recommended)
* Docker engine installed and configured
* OpenLane workspace clone with configured Sky130 PDK

---

### Step 1: Execute Functional Verification

Verify the behavioral netlist prior to logic translation:

# Compile design and testbench modules
```
iverilog -o tb_rca src/rca.v src/tb_rca.v
```
# Execute simulation runtime to output VCD dump
```
vvp tb_rca
```
# Open wave structures visually
```
gtkwave rca.vcd
```
### Step 2: Run the Physical Design Pipeline

Move this design directory inside your native OpenLane installation route under `<OpenLane_Root>/designs/`.

# 1. Mount the interactive OpenLane environment container
```
make mount
```

# 2. Run the automated layout generation script
```
./flow.tcl -design rca
```
